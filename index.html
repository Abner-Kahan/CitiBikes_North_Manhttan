    <i><strong>Harlem </strong> </i> 
    - the neighborhood of Harlem portrays the heart of Upper Manhattan, expanding over 29 census tracts. Its central portion encompasses a wide variety of buildings that attract numerous citizens. These range from small spaces, such as local stores and cafes, to larger, public areas, including schools, parks, and religious centers. As a result, there are multiple locations to establish CitiBike stands in order to provide a faster method of transportation across Manhattan. Similarly, Harlem has many train stations and bus stops that New Yorkers utilize daily for their commutes. Hence, placing CitiBikes at and near these spots will be a more efficient means to avoid heavy traffic while reducing time on local commutes (as opposed to walking). Likewise, the diversity of the Harlem population will make the CitiBike program appealing to all of its citizens, meaning that the bikes will not go to waste. Therefore, Citibike stations in Harlem will allow for residents to gain a manner of commuting to save both time and money, which will boost its overall productivity and progress in the neighborhood.
